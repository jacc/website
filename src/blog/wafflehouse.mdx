In late September of 2024, Hurricane Helene was spiraling towards Florida, my home state. My university had cancelled classes for the week, and while people were barricading their homes, I was spending time reverse engineering Waffle House’s website.

Why you may ask?

If you’ve never heard of the Waffle House Index, you’re in for a bit of weirdly fascinating disaster response lore. The Waffle House Index is an (incredibly) unofficial index used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to gauge the severity of natural disasters. Why Waffle House? Because Waffle House is infamous for not closing during the worst of storms. If the House is down, that means things are getting real.

The problem with the Waffle House Index is that there’s really not an actual “index” you can check. No live feed, no map, just a few wisps of a mention on Wikipedia pages and articles throughout the web (including one blog post on their actual website!)

..so naturally, I built one.

I already dove into the technical side of things in a YouTube video I published, which I’ll link below; but here’s the technical gist of how the site worked.

## The Technicals

Waffle House uses Next.js for their site (or at least, their location information site). Incredibly based choice, by the way - but this meant that they also utilized React Server Components, which made it incredibly hard to scrape or find any single source of truth for data about the websites.

After spending more time than I’d like to admit digging through their source code, I ended up finding a Next.js build file, in JSON, that had information about every single open location, their status, and more importantly, **if they were closed**.

Using some light data scraping and processing with Python, along with a Next.js frontend & Redis implementation for caching, I was able to make a live map that tracked which Waffle Houses were closed, and by extension, which parts of the country might be going south.

If you're curious about how I ended up finding the file and the technical implications of the site, watch the YouTube video below:

    referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowFullScreen
    className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full rounded-lg mb-2"
  />
</div>

## The Beginning of the End

After I created the site, I snapped up wafflehouseindex[.]org and threw it up on Vercel, then sent a (now deleted) tweet out about it.

My account when I tweeted it out had less than 200 followers. I wasn’t truly expecting them to see it, nor for it to go absolutely viral.

Until they did see it. And then the corporate account was suddenly replying to my tweet, saying that the information was incorrect and any information about closures would come from their official communication channels.

![F](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019633433800101940/1293284609051721781/Orion_10-08-2024__02.51PM2x.png?ex=683366a6&is=68321526&hm=a8c004af1f91fa5dc10ece220957bd5a592218a9617071fbf3822520e06e4aaa&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1896&height=2170)

Which, first of all, I can understand - but I was quite literally USING their data for this, so it’s not that it really was incorrect at all. But either way, seeing as the entire situation was making me laugh, I re-tweeted their response to me in jest saying “haha, now you do!”, not really thinking much of it. Who would think that the mega-chain breakfast place would be spending their time replying to a teenager online talking about if their stores were closed?

That was the case, until Frank Luntz (American political commentator commonly seen on CNBC, Bloomberg, among others. But also someone with a 400,000+ follower count on Twitter) somehow saw my tweet and took interest in the site.

### Mom, get the cameras!

At that point, I started sweating a little bit. Obviously being recognized for your work online is very cool, but it’s another to be casually chatting with a massive news influencer about a random half-joke half-engineering marvel that I made.

Frank decided to share the site with a Tweet directly linking to my site. Within minutes, I had a few hundred people on my site, poking and prodding at the index and taking a look at the map.

Unfortunately, the devil works hard, but Waffle House’s marketing (and at this point, probably legal) team works harder. They swiftly replied to Frank’s tweet echoing what they had replied to me - that the site was unofficial and incorrect, and any information they’d have would come from an official Waffle House account. Frank, wanting to maintain his credibility, very quickly apologized and deleted the site.

I figured that would be the end of it until, I went to go look back at what they said.

Their tweet was gone.

What?

... oh!

### Kicked (and scolded) out the House

In a million years did I not expect that one coming. Two responses to their tweets about an “unofficial” website and I get blocked?

In hindsight, I can imagine that my actions probably stressed some poor marketing person out and they needed to do damage control somehow. Regardless, it’s incredibly funny that I got _blocked_ by the breakfast chain.

Shortly after getting blocked (and after the hurricane had passed), I woke up to an email from someone with a Very High Up Position at Waffle House informing me that I need to immediately “cease and desist all unauthorized use of Trademarks owned by WH Intellectual, LLC and any confusingly similar marks in connection with your website”.

I was honestly more surprised at the fact that the silly logo that I made (a very great representation, if I do say so myself) was what got me yelled at by them, and not anything to do with scraping or reverse engineering their site.

You may be asking yourself, how did I reply?

Great question.

### With Respect and Syrup

I gave my response the same treatment as I did the rest of this entire process: complete silliness.

![Me replying to Waffle House](/images/whemailreply.png)

- “huge fan of the House”
- "Waffle House has become much like the American Flag in the Star Spangled Banner"
- “honor and respect Waffle House with this data”
- and finally, “with respect and syrup”.

The Very High Up Person actually did reply to this with much less legal jargon than the first email and was very down to earth with me, even thanking me for wanting to help out with the recovery efforts. But at the end of the day, I was still violating their trademarks and needed to take it down.

I did take it down and even emailed back asking if there was anything I could do, but unfortunately got ghosted after that.

# The End of the End

In conclusion.. yeah finish this eventually!
